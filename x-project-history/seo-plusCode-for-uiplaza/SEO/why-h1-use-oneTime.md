# Why Use Only One `<h1>` Tag Per Page?

Using a single `<h1>` tag per page is a widely recommended **SEO best practice**, but it’s not a strict rule. Here's why it's still encouraged.

---

## ✅ SEO & Semantic Structure

| Element | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `<h1>` | Represents the **main topic of the entire page**. It's like the title of a book. |
| `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. | Represent subtopics and sections within the page. Think of them as chapter headings and subheadings. |

> ✅ **Best practice:** One `<h1>` per page to define the page's primary purpose, followed by properly nested headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.).

## 🤔 Is it *required* to have only one `<h1>`?

No — it's **not required**.

HTML5 allows multiple `<h1>` tags, especially when using semantic sections (like `<section>` or `<article>`). However:

### 💡 Why we **still recommend one `<h1>`**:
- **Clarity for SEO & crawlers**: One `<h1>` clearly tells search engines what the page is about.
- **Consistency**: Many SEO tools expect a single `<h1>`, and may flag multiple as an issue.
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers use `<h1>` as a landmark for the main topic.

## ✅ What to Do Instead of Multiple `<h1>`s

Use `<h1>` once for the main page topic, then `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. for sub-sections.

### Example:

```html
<h1>UIPlaza – Marketplace for Premium UI</h1>

<h2>Top UI Kits</h2>
<h3>Modern Dashboard Kit</h3>

<h2>Templates</h2>
<h3>Landing Page Template</h3>
```

## 🔍 Summary

| ✅ Do This | ❌ Avoid This |
|-----------|--------------|
| Use one `<h1>` for the main topic | Don’t use multiple `<h1>`s unless semantically justified |
| Use `<h2>`–`<h6>` for subsections | Don’t use `<h1>`s just for visual size |
| Follow a logical heading structure | Don’t jump levels randomly (`<h1>` → `<h4>`) |

---

💡 **Tip:** If your design requires multiple large titles, use `<h2>` or `<h3>` and apply CSS to style them as needed.

```css
h2.big-heading {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

This keeps your HTML **semantically clean** and your SEO **well-structured**.
