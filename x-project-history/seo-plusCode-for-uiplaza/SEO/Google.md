You can still get indexed by Google even if you don’t submit your sitemap in Google Search Console, but there are some important details to know:

1️⃣ How Google Finds Your Site Without GSC

Google can discover pages by crawling links from other websites.

If your site is linked from social media, other sites, or internal links, Google may eventually index it.

Googlebot will try to find your /sitemap.xml automatically if it’s referenced in robots.txt:

Sitemap: https://uiplaza.vercel.app/sitemap.xml

2️⃣ Limitations

Slower indexing: Without submitting a sitemap, it can take days or weeks for Google to crawl all pages.

No detailed feedback: You won’t see crawl errors, indexing status, or issues that might prevent some pages from being indexed.

No direct control: You can’t request Google to re-crawl pages immediately.

3️⃣ Benefits of Submitting in Google Search Console

Faster indexing: You can request indexing immediately.

Crawl errors visibility: See 404s, blocked pages, or other issues.

Performance monitoring: Track clicks, impressions, and search queries.

✅ Recommendation

You can skip GSC, but it’s highly recommended to submit your sitemap.

At minimum, keep /robots.txt pointing to your sitemap so Google can discover it automatically.
