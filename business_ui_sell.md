Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre strong at business ideas and idea-based website design, but you haven‚Äôt executed a real business yet. This affects how you can position your work for pricing. Let‚Äôs break it down carefully.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Your Current Value

Your Strengths:

You can design complete websites based on ideas (UI/UX, layout, branding, concept).

You can visualize business concepts and translate them into a functional website concept.


Your Limitation:

You haven‚Äôt built or run a business yourself, so your expertise in ‚Äúreal-world business strategy + growth‚Äù is limited.

This impacts whether someone would pay a premium for a fully business-ready product, not just a website.



üí° Insight: Your value right now is in design + idea translation, not in business execution.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Pricing Strategy

Option A: Sell as a UI/UX / Website Design Project

Market it as:

Complete website design and prototype

Includes UI/UX design, branding, and concept visualization


Pricing Range:

Depends on complexity, market, and client size:

Simple website: $50‚Äì$150 (BDT 5‚Äì20K)

Medium business website: $150‚Äì$500 (BDT 15‚Äì50K)

Complex idea-based or custom design: $500+ (BDT 50K+)



Pros:

You are charging fairly for what you can deliver

Avoids over-promising business results


Cons:

Some clients may expect full business execution, so clarity is needed




---

Option B: Try to Sell ‚ÄúBusiness Idea + Website‚Äù Package

Market it as:

A ready-to-launch website concept for a business idea

Includes: UI/UX, branding, workflow, and functional prototype


Pricing Reality:

High price ($500‚Äì$2,000+) is possible only if clients believe your idea has business potential

Since you have no real-life business execution, risk of rejection is higher


Pros:

Potential high-ticket sale

Clients looking for innovation may pay premium


Cons:

Harder to convince clients

They may undervalue the website if no real business proof exists

3Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Suggestions

1. Start by selling design services first

Focus on UI/UX, branding, and website prototypes

Build client trust and portfolio

Once you have success stories, you can gradually sell business + website packages



2. Showcase idea-to-design transformation

Demonstrate how you turn a business idea into a working website concept

Use this in your portfolio to justify higher rates



3. Optional: Partner with business executors

Collaborate with someone who can implement the business

You provide the idea + website, they provide real-life business execution

This allows you to charge higher prices legitimately



4. Clarify deliverables with clients

Make it clear: ‚ÄúI provide website + design + prototype; business growth execution is not included.‚Äù





---

üí° Bottom Line

Right now, you should price according to your design + website skills, not full business execution.

Selling the website alone as UI/UX + functional prototype is legitimate and safer.

Over time, as you gain experience or partner with others, you can sell complete business-ready website packages at higher prices.
